## My process
1. figure out most of what i need to do by looking at the challenge and taking it all in.
2. code the html markup and all of the content.
3. code all of the base css styling 
4. code all of my own css styling and the responsive side of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned the importance of a read me file in my work and solution and that it should not be overlooked.

the big coding take aways for where starting from mobile and using responsive desgn to work my way up to a full scale version on pc.

### Continued development

I feel the key areas i need to work on going forward are advanced css and responsive work and media qwuerries.

## Acknowledgments

what really helped me in this project was just loking on the internet at other simular cards and really understanding how to break a project down into sections and work on it one section at a time.
